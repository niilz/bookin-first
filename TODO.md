# TODO

- Remove trailing String parts on PHPSESS-Cookie (not sure if that is still the case)
- Handle errors e.g. when Slot can not be read (is it a parsing problem?) or when Course is not bookable
- Store token and session (cache)
- Add appointment to calendar
- implement delete
- implement unsupervised run (for course and slot)
