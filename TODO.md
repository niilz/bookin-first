# TODO

- conver list of classes to objects (serde)
- Write tests for the fitness-service (read-classes)
- Store token and session (cache)
- Extract class-ids
- Load slots
- confirm slot by using user-id, class-id, slot-id (I think ;)
- Retrieve client-id by first calling fitness-first and then calling egym (instead of taking it as arg)
