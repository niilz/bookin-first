# TODO

- Login to page to get session-token (kinda done)
- Retrieve session cookie from response
- Store token and session (cache)
- Retrieve list of classes
- Extract class-ids
- Load slots
- confirm slot by using user-id, class-id, slot-id (I think ;)
- Retrieve client-id by first calling fitness-first and then calling egym (instead of taking it as arg)
