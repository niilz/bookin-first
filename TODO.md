# TODO

- Implement fetch_courses for lambda (use fitness-service directly)
- Remove trailing String parts on PHPSESS-Cookie
- Try to use api with session token even though if it is not from fitness-first page (like grab other peoples data with your token)
- Handle errors e.g. when Slot can not be read (is it a parsing problem?) or when Course is not bookable
- Store token and session (cache)
- Add appointment to calendar
- implement delete
- implement unsupervised run (for course and slot)
