# TODO

- Use Clap to take command-line args for user, password, client-id (for now)
- extract token from response
- Login to page to get session-token
- Store token
- Retrieve list of classes
- Extract class-ids
- Load slots
- confirm slot by using user-id, class-id, slot-id (I think ;)
- Retrieve client-id by first calling fitness-first and then calling egym (instead of taking it as arg)
