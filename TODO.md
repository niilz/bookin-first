# TODO

- Try to use api with session token even though if it is not from fitness-first page
- Set up lambda to do login
- Handle errors e.g. when Slot can not be read (is it a parsing problem?)
- Do NOT store token and session in LoginService (very bad design decision)
- Store token and session (cache)
- Add appointment to calendar
- implement delete
- implement unsupervised run (for course and slot)
- maybe it can happen that course is not bookable: handle that
